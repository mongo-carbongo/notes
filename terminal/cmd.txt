# delete a file

# force delete files marked as read only
del /f <path/filename>

#delete all files with the .log extension
del *.log

#delete all files with the prefix home
del home**

#delete all files having the word end somewhere in the filename
del *end**

#erase multiple files
del file1 file2 file3 file4

#erase an entire folder or directory (only if it is empty)
rmdir "Documents"

#If has sub-directories
rmdir /s "Documents"

If you receive a prompt to delete the file, type ‘Y' and press ‘Enter'.

/s removes all directories and files in a particular directory
in addition to the directory itself.

If you do not want to see the prompt, use the command /q.
The /q is a quiet mode that does not ask if you can remove a directory tree.
rmdir /s /q "Documents"

Example 1 with user prompt:

mkdir hello
cd hello
mkdir world
cd ..
rmdir hello

Confirm
The item at C:\users\mauro\downloads\hello has children and the Recurse
parameter was not specified. If you continue, all
children will be removed with the item. Are you sure you want to continue?
[Y] Yes  [A] Yes to All  [N] No  [L] No to All  [S] Suspend
[?] Help (default is "Y"):

Example 2 with no user prompt
mkdir hello
cd hello
mkdir world
cd ..
rmdir hello


#print working directory
cd

Example
D:\>cd

D:\>cd books

D:\Books>cd

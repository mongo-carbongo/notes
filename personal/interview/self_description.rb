Hi, my name is mauricio and i am here today for the interview. Thank you very much.

1. Skills and qualities you have that are a must to the role you are applying for:

  I completed a technical degree in digital audio production and managed
  to get a job in the live music industry. After 5 years i realized
  i wasn't cut out for that job and decided to move to a different field.
  I made my degree on Electronic engineering, and studied web development
  through online books and tutorials, then a friend of mine
  helped me to join the company where he works which is actually a startup company. And i
  started gaining experience in the IT world, and now i have more or less 2 years
  of experience and i feel really happy working in this area.

2. Talk about any experience or qualifications you possess that are relevant
to the position


  when i started working as a support analyst i began writing SQL queries,
  and applying direct modifications over a
  data base to fix employer and employees data. Then moved to
  active record queries to make similar modifications

  I've experience using project management software (atlassian jira), i've
  worked on remote software
  installation (through a technology called boardgent),
  also i've experience on equipment inventory and equipment maintenance.

  I've worked with a model view controller approach, active records queries,
  active records relations, migrations, engines, services, jobs,
  stimulus js, stimulus reflex, view components, slim,
  css through tailwind framework,
  i've worked also with bootstrap
  i've also worked with javasctipt

  and that's it, currentl we use basecamp and agile practices to work on
  different pitchs making
  our app more functional and easy to use.

3. Talk about any significant achievements you have gained in your work life or
 personal life so far.
4. Talk about the type of person you are and what you are going to do in the
  role if they hire you

  the most challenging situation that i have faced at my work, was
  tryng to undesrstand the code written by a teammate, he left
  the project unfinished so the hard part was to grasp and comprehend
  what he as tryng to do
   he used active model
  which Allows implementing models similar to ActiveRecord::Base.

  and for the purpose of the pitch he used a lot of callbacks and
  initialization tricks that i couldnt understand easilly

  At first i had to read out all de documentation and make unitary tests
  to have  a human readable output of the the work which consisted
  of a payment gateway integrtion for a local Bank


  The chaparral ecosystem is a plant and animal community that is relatively
  rare. It is characterized by shrubland and a specific weather pattern.
  Winters in this ecosystem are mild and wet, and the summers tend to be hot
  and dry. The state of California in the United States has one of the world’s
  largest chaparral ecosystems. They can also be found in parts of northern
  Mexico, Australia, Chile, and South Africa.
  Wildfires occur frequently in this ecosystem. Lots of very flammable plant
  growth builds up in between fire seasons. Only about 15-39 inches of rain
  fall each year. Shrub plants of the chaparral are most likely to catch fire in the late summer or early fall. That’s because the summers are extra dry. The thought of fire is frightening to people with homes or businesses. However, it is far more dangerous not to have wildfires. When there are no fires, the shrubs take over. Small fires once in a while are beneficial. They keep the plant growth under control. They also act in some other surprising ways. There are some plant species in chaparral ecosystems that cannot reproduce unless there has been a fire.
  The heat, smoke and changes in the soil that follow a burn actually release seeds from some plants.
  What causes the frequent fires in this region? Sometimes lightning strikes
  will catch plants on fire. However, this accounts for only a small portion
   of the fires. Humans are the cause of many wildfires. A match, cigarette or
   campfire left carelessly unattended can cause a fire. Hot, dry winds, like
   the Santa Ana winds in California, make the fire go wild. If it has been a long time since the last fire, plants will fuel the fire. It is often very difficult for firefighters to put out these fires.
  People who live in and near chaparral ecosystems have to clear plants from
  around their homes. This helps to prevent the home from being damaged in a fire.
  Although there are hazards in this ecosystem, people can take steps to remain
   safe. Wildfires are a natural and important part of a healthy chaparral ecosystem.

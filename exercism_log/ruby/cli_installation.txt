Determine processor architecture on Linux
To determine your processor architecture, paste in the following command into
your terminal:

uname -m
Hit Enter after you have pasted in the command and examine the output.

x86_64

If the output is x86_64 then you are on a 64-bit architecture.

The file you are looking for is exercism-linux-64bit.tgz.

Extract the executable

If you’re using the command line (use the right archive file name for your
architecture):

tar -xf exercism-linux-64bit.tgz

in my case:
/mnt/c/users/mauro/Downloads$ tar -xf exercism-3.1.0-linux-x86_64.tar.gz

Moving the Executable to ~/bin
Once you download and extract the archive, make it available in your $PATH.

First, let’s make sure the directory exists:

mkdir -p ~/bin

Next, let’s move the exercism executable there:

mv exercism ~/bin

In my case:
mauro@DESKTOP-O876LFR:/mnt/c/users/mauro/Downloads$ mv exercism ~/bin

Make sure everything worked:

~/bin/exercism
The above should output something like the below:

A command-line interface for the v2 redesign of Exercism.

Adding ~/bin to $PATH in Bash
Note: If you’re not running Bash try to adjust the below to your shell or
Talk to a Volunteer.

To have the exercism executable available everywhere on the command line you
need to make sure ~/bin is in your $PATH.

There is a chance it’s there already; let’s see whether it is:

[[ ":$PATH:" == *":$HOME/bin:"* || ":$PATH:" == *":~/bin:"* ]] && echo "~/bin is in PATH" || echo "~/bin is not in PATH"

If the above prints ~/bin is not in PATH let’s add ~/bin to $PATH and
reload Bash configuration:

echo 'export PATH=~/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bash_profile
source ~/.bash_profile
To check whether this worked, try to run exercism without providing the path:

exercism


Configuring the CLI
In order to configure the CLI, paste in the following text into your terminal:

exercism configure --token=71b4c927-a9c6-4be6-bba0-e50c8ca3346b
You can find your token on your settings page.

my token:
exercism configure --token=71b4c927-a9c6-4be6-bba0-e50c8ca3346b
After typing in the command, hit the Enter key.

After hitting the Enter key, you should see a notification from the CLI that a
configuration file has been written.

Important: The token above should be treated like a password and not be shared
with anyone!
When asking for help that involves a command, remove your token before sharing
the command.


Important! The source command and the .bash_profile
changed the behaviour of my terminal,
It also affected the Vscode debuger settings that i had configured
so i had to remove the previously added .bash_profile file.


Then i checked the terminal and the exercism command worked, i Also
checked the PATH variable and there was the ~/bin reference.

The debugger works on the exercism i was working on.

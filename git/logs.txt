When working on atom note's i was trying to download the
remote repo for the Ubuntu VM.

I couldn't fetch nor pull the repo so i checked for
the remote repo at github.com

There wasnÂ´t any files inside the notes folder so
i assume that i connected the account on atom but
didn't upload the local changes.

I also checked and i didn't had git installed in
windows so i went to the official git page and
download it.

Then when i was able to use git in the terminal
i went to:

c:\Users\mauro\github\notes

git remote add origin git@github.com:mongo-carbongo/notes.git

error: remote origin already exists.

git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

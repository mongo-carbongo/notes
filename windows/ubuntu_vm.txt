Unattended Guest installation resulted in a malfunctioning terminal
so, installed the VM manually, then installed guest additions via terminal:

sudo apt-get install virtualbox-guest-additions-iso

That didn't fixed the screen problem but fixed the
malfunctioning terminal, so :

1. click Show Applications icon in the VM
2. type displays in the search bar to open settings,
3. over there select screen resolution mine's (1920*1080)
